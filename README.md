PROBLEM STATEMENT:
CCTV CAMERAS ARE USED ONLY TO STORE THE DATA AND INFORMATION IN A PARTICULAR DATABASE,WHEREAS THESE SECURITY SURVEILLANCE INTIMATES THE USER IN REAL TIME.

DESCRIPTION OF THE IDEA:
OUR IDEA IS PROPOSED IN SUCH A WAY TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION FOR THE USER.WHEN THERE IS ANY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY FOUND IN A USERâ€™S PLACE ,OUR SMART SURVEILLANCE IS USED TO DETECT THE SUSPICIOUS AND INTIMATE THE USER ABOUT THE ACTIVITY WITH THE CURRENT LOCATION WITH THE ALERT MESSAGE THROUGH THEIR MOBILE PHONES.ALSO,IT CAN BE USED AS A PLUGIN. SO THAT IT CAN BE USED ONLY AT THE SURVEILLANCE.

The Haar Cascade algorithm, developed by Viola and Jones, is a popular computer vision algorithm used for face detection. It works by scanning an image for areas with a similar pattern as the one that the algorithm has been trained to recognize. This algorithm is known for its ability to detect faces in real-time, making it a valuable tool in surveillance systems.

The HOG algorithm, on the other hand, is used for object detection. It works by computing a histogram of gradient orientations in an image and using it to detect objects. This algorithm has been used in a variety of applications, including pedestrian detection and traffic sign recognition.

When combined, the Haar Cascade and HOG algorithms create a powerful tool for smart surveillance. This technology can recognize and track objects and people in real-time, making it an effective solution for public safety.
